# Project Guidelines

## Code Structure & Quality
- **Modular Design**: Generate code in distinct, logical modules with clear responsibilities for improved organization and collaboration.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate UI, business logic, and data access layers with explicit interfaces for maintainability.
- **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive, domain-specific names for variables, functions, and classes to enhance readability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with informative messages and recovery strategies.

## Development Patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive and adaptive design patterns for cross-device compatibility.
- **Consistent Coding Style**: Follow uniform coding standards including indentation, naming conventions, and formatting for maintainable code.
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on optimizing application performance and scalability for better user experience.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Consider microservices for complex applications to improve scalability and maintenance.

## Security & Compliance
- **Input Validation**: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Security Best Practices**: Follow industry security standards to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Testing Standards**: Follow the standards below.
  - Unit tests required for business logic
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - E2E tests for critical user flows
- **End-to-End Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing strategies to ensure application reliability.
- **Essential Documentation**: Include these key documents:
  - **README**: High-level project overview, setup instructions, and quick start guide
  - **Technical Design Document**: Implementation details, component designs, and API specifications
  - **API Documentation**: Endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples
  - **Code Comments**: Inline explanations for complex logic and algorithms
  - **User Guides**: Concise instructions for end-users
- **Legal Compliance Documentation**: Include documentation on licensing, open-source usage, and regulatory compliance.
- **Other Requirements**:
  - Save 'README' in the project root but all other docs should be in 'docs/' folder.
  - Keep 'README' in sync with new capabilities
  - Update relevant documentation in '/docs' when modifying features
  - Use conda environment and always create a new virtual environment per project
  - Use config.yaml for any project-related config
  - Use .env for sensitive configuration like api-key, etc.
  - Use example code in examples/ for reference
